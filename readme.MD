## What is Zeitgeist?
So I plan to create this as a tool to measure the current zeitgeist of a particular topic. The end 
goal is a website where you can specify a topic and some filters (country, demographics, year?)
and this will give you a barometer over time.

Inspired by a barometer I saw for the flaming trash pile that is brexit. I want to take this concept
and run with it. 

This is a learning exercise, and I have some familiarity with docker already, so I've opted to create
this application in docker containers, and using kubernetes as an orchestrator with spark streaming
 (or storm) to process analytics real time.
